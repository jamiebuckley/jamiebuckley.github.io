    <p>
        I first got into code around age 12, while watching the film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244244/">Swordfish</a>.  
        It occurred to me that what Hugh Jackman's character was doing - hacking a mainframe - or other similar tech trope, was the closest to magic that you could get in real life.
        The film also starred Halle Berry, who seemed very impressed by Hugh's technical skills.
        I resolved to become an expert in such things, no matter what it took.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, while this wasn't <em>before</em> the internet, so to speak, we didn't have the internet at home, so learning to code involved buying a copy of "The Idiot's Guide to Visual Basic", with an accompanying trial CD for VB6.
    </p>
    <p>
        I self taught for many years, studying any technical topic that came my way, but never did anything serious with it.  
        Debugging without the internet was not easy, and involved lots of reading and guesswork, along with things that seem crazy by today's standards such as: 
        <ul>
            <li>Taking a bus several hours across London to go to a computer fair, to pick up discount books</li>
            <li>Taking pocket money to an internet cafe, to find potential solutions on forums - and print out pages of stuff to take home</li>
        </ul>
    </p>    
    <p>It wasn't until many years later at university while studying Psychology - 
        and the moment where we had to use some awful bespoke software for a course that refused to run on anyone's machine, that I realised that:
        <ul>
            <li>a: I could write something better.</li>
            <li>b: I was spending all my time in the Computer Science section of the University library instead of the Psychology section</li>
            <li>c: There was a career in this, as no one seemed to understand computers.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        I did a conversion MsC in Computer Science after finishing Psychology - and had the definite feeling of "This is my career" that had been lacking during Psychology.
    </p>

    <p>
        My first job after university was in a company that wrote software for 'estates departments', essentially departments of schools, universities and hospitals that are in charge of maintaining buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was far from glamorous - other than the occasional deep dive into something involving AutoCAD, it typically involved creating very large forms based applications to meet some
        sort of building regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I was jealous of my former co-students, who had seemed to go off to more exciting tech jobs in shinier cities than Swansea - I now realise how much I learned in this first job:
        <ul>
            <li>How to gather requirements from non technical people directly</li>
            <li>How to manage tech debt in large codebases, with minimal time and money</li>
            <li>How to upskill on new codebases quickly</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        After several further jobs, in the travel industry and banking sector, I ventured into contracting.  Contractors get a bad rap sometimes, especially from permanent staff,
        but the attraction to me was that I had not yet worked for an organisation that had any interest or ability in upskilling it's staff.  
        I consistently found myself in the position of teaching others, and rarely being taught myself.  This was largely due to living in a semi-rural area - and contracting potentially opened up the opportunity to work further afield.
    </p>
    <p>Curiously, the first contract was close to home, and was everything one might want.  The technical ability of the team was very high, and I felt I was surrounded by people to learn from.</p>
    <p>Several contracts later, and partly due to knowing the right people at the right time - I was offered a permanent job with a client - as Head of Engineering.</p>
    <p>This brings us up to now.</p>
    <p>
        Many things have changed over my career - I have become more risk averse, and seen enough technical failures (several my own) to know what to avoid.  
        I have met many people who did things better than I could do myself, and who I strive to emulate.
        I have increasingly placed less value on shiny new frameworks, and far more on conversation and shared understanding.
    </p>
    <p>One thing has not changed, in that I still feel like I am Hugh Jackman in an early 2000s action movie while I write code.</p>
